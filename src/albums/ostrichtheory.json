			title:"NEVER QUESTION",
			lyrics:"you never question why
					you’ve got it so good
					you never questioned why
					’cause it’s understood
					you never questioned why
					you just complain
					you never question why
					you just played the game

					it’s easy now to forget
					when you’re happy
					your belly’s full
					but the food is shit

					you never question why
					your name was on the list
					you never questioned why
					but you somehow got the gist
					you never questioned why
					it all seems the same
					you never question why
					when you feel no pain

					it’s easy now to forget
					when you’re happy
					robbing Paul for your debt
					to Peter
					it’s easy now to forget
					when he’s gone

					you never question why
					they said it was free
					you never questioned why
					now you pay the fee"

			title:"PILGRIM",
			lyrics:"suddenly a light blinds your eyes
					but now you see
					watch the flame as it dances
					like it’s just for me

					but it’s not what you came for
					it’s what you need
					you’re holding a flame and you know
					this makes you feel so alive

					honesty so perfect
					how it binds you to me
					you can change the subject
					but it won’t change a thing

					cuz it’s not what you came for
					it’s what you need
					there’s no one to blame no
					just get the ring and go

					crossing the line
					taking the time
					I’ll pay for this
					but they say it’s wrong and it shows
					no playing around
					no playing it out
					it’s dangerous
					so kill it before it grows"

			title:"INTO THE WIND",
			lyrics:"I leaned into the wind
					she said “get in”
					then down came the rain
					in the space between down came the pain
					then she opened her eyes
					what have I done

					I knew
					there was never shelter there with you

					I flew
					like the wind I’m just passing through
					and so you’ll fade away
					no shelter today

					it’s you
					reminding me of how I lost my youth
					come to
					shake the leaves and try and find the fruit

					but it’s gone away
					what have we done

					I knew
					there was never shelter there with you
					I do
					wish that I could hide inside of you
					but things will never change
					till we face the rain
					and when this rage goes
					what have I done"

			title:"WHAT I WANT",
			lyrics:"why don’t we ever get what we deserve
					just ask the rich men who inherit the earth
					or ask an indian about manifest destiny
					or ask this bottle how the fuck it gets the best of me

					can somebody tell me why we can’t get along
					maybe we could just sing
					the corus to this song
					if history has taught me anything
					I have to fuck you
					fuck you
					to get what I want

					the U.S.A. is under Satan’s authority
					that is of course if you believe in that sort of thing
					you want a slice of the American pie
					I don’t have a slice and I’m wondering why

					CHORUS

					law and order is a tool to stall the revolution
					peace is just a temporary solution
					and they don’t understand a word I’ve said
					because they’re members of the walking dead"

			title:"RESTLESS",
			lyrics:"no you’re not alone
					so far away from home
					with all this restlessness
					you caress your emptiness
					you’re not the only one

					no you can’t hurt me
					I’ll just hurt myself
					now this love is empty
					and your being used
					try to justify this hate
					when your afraid
					now there’s no rest here
					in the bed you made

					what god would watch this mess
					I think he needs some company
					there was a time you were wide
					open to me

					CHORUS

					stay over there
					I’ll love you from afar
					stay away
					till you you can live with who you are
					alone
					try to justify this hate
					when your afraid
					now there’s no rest here
					in the bed you made"

			title:"TOOL",
			lyrics:"maybe I’m not a very good tool
					or maybe you just don’t know how to use me
					maybe I’m in the wrong machiene
					or maybe I’m waking up from the dream

					with everything
					between us
					now we know
					it’s all right
					to be alone

					I’m a little fucked up
					there’s something wrong with me
					is that the case
					or did I have to get

					outside to see

					CHORUS

					and now that I need you all
					so desperately
					I’ll figure it all out
					I’ll figure it all out
					it’s so human of me
					to take controll
					to take a soul"

			title:"DIGITAL",
			lyrics:"with a heart like a battlefield
					and a mind like a race track
					64 bit technology
					but the words you can’t take back

					digital sunshine lights your eyes
					electronic sin tucks you in at night

					our parents in ignorance
					the newest ways for the oldest sins
					slow motion suicide
					what’s it take, open up your eyes

					digital sunshine lights your eyes
					electronic sin tucks you in at night
					numbers in and out that rule the world
					serving many, serving none

					regress
					prgogress

					with a heart like a battlefield
					and a mind like a race track
					there’s only so much you can feel
					when your brain is break back

			lyrics:"gonna kill your soul and leave your body behind
					get your head out of your ass if you don’t mind
					it’s all because you look the other way

					I’ll pay you cash and there’s no time for reasons why
					he’s coming for can’t you see

			title:"32ND FLOOR",
			lyrics:"on the 32nd Floor
					he couldn’t take anymore
					there was life out there
					somewhere down below
					he found himself so high
					it made him wonder why
					he knew
					one day he would fly
					if only he’d try

					he never broke the rules
					always followed fools
					they never knew the monster that would grow
					one day he met a girl
					and she would change his world
					show him things, things he never knew
					yeah he never knew

					it made him say
					hey, we’re going to do it my way
					a push of the button and we all get paid
					don’t be afraid
					don’t be afraid
					what goes up comes down
