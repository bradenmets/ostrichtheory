        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>you never question why<br />
          you've got it so good<br />
          you never questioned why<br />
          'cause it's understood<br />
          you never questioned why<br />
          you just complain<br />
          you never question why<br />
          you just played the game</p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          it's easy now to forget<br />
          when you're happy<br />
          your belly's full<br />
          but the food is shit<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>you never question why<br />
          your name was on the list<br />
          you never questioned why<br />
          but you somehow got the gist<br />
          you never questioned why<br />
          it all seems the same<br />
          you never question why<br />
          when you feel no pain</p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          it's easy now to forget<br />
          when you're happy<br />
          robbing Paul for your debt<br />
          to Peter<br />
          it's easy now to forget<br />
          when he's gone<br />

        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>you never question why<br />
          they said it was free<br />

        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          suddenly a light blinds your eyes<br />
          but now you see<br />
          watch the flame as it dances<br />
          like it's just for me<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          but it's not what you came for<br />
          it's what you need<br />
          you're holding a flame and you know<br />
          this makes you feel so alive<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          honesty so perfect<br />
          how it binds you to me<br />
          you can change the subject<br />
          but it won't change a thing<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          cuz it's not what you came for<br />
          it's what you need<br />
          there's no one to blame no<br />
          just get the ring and go<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          crossing the line<br />
          taking the time<br />
          I'll pay for this<br />
          but they say it's wrong and it shows<br />
          no playing around<br />
          no playing it out<br />
          it's dangerous<br />
          so kill it before it grows<br />

        <h1 style={{color: 'white'}}>Into The Wind</h1>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          I leaned into the wind<br />
          she said "get in"<br />
          then down came the rain<br />
          in the space between down came the pain<br />
          then she opened her eyes<br />
          what have I done<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          I knew<br />
          there was never shelter there with you<br />   
          I flew<br />
          like the wind I'm just passing through<br />
          and so you'll fade away<br />
          no shelter today<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          it's you<br />
          reminding me of how I lost my youth<br />
          come to<br />
          shake the leaves and try and find the fruit<br /> 
          but it's gone away<br />
          what have we done<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          I knew<br />
          there was never shelter there with you<br />
          I do<br />
          wish that I could hide inside of you<br />
          but things will never change<br />
          till we face the rain<br />
          and when this rage goes<br />
          what have I done<br />
        </p>
        <h1 style={{color: 'white'}}> What I Want </h1>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          why don't we ever get what we deserve<br />
          just ask the rich men who inherit the earth<br />
          or ask an indian about manifest destiny<br />
          or ask this bottle how the fuck it gets the best of me<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          can somebody tell me why we can't get along<br />
          maybe we could just sing<br />
          the corus to this song<br />
          if history has taught me anything<br />
          I have to fuck you<br />
          fuck you<br />
          to get what I want<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          the U.S.A. is under Satan's authority<br />
          that is of course if you believe in that sort of thing<br />
          you want a slice of the American pie<br />
          I don't have a slice and I'm wondering why<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          CHORUS
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          law and order is a tool to stall the revolution<br />
          peace is just a temporary solution<br />
          and they don't understand a word I've said<br />
          because they're members of the walking dead<br />
        </p>
        <h1 style={{color: 'white'}}>Restless</h1>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          no you're not alone<br />
          so far away from home<br />
          with all this restlessness<br />
          you caress your emptiness<br />
          you're not the only one<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          no you can't hurt me<br />
          I'll just hurt myself<br />
          now this love is empty<br />
          and your being used<br />
          try to justify this hate<br />
          when your afraid<br />
          now there's no rest here<br />
          in the bed you made<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          what god would watch this mess<br />
          I think he needs some company<br />
          there was a time you were wide<br />
          open to me<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          CHORUS

        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          stay over there<br />
          I'll love you from afar<br />
          stay away<br />
          till you you can live with who you are<br />
          alone<br />
          try to justify this hate<br />
          when your afraid<br />
          now there's no rest here<br />
          in the bed you made<br />
        </p>
        <h1 style={{color: 'white'}}>Tool</h1>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          maybe I'm not a very good tool<br />
          or maybe you just don't know how to use me<br />
          maybe I'm in the wrong machiene<br />
          or maybe I'm waking up from the dream<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          with everything<br />
          between us<br />
          now we know<br />
          it's all right<br />
          to be alone<br />
        </p>
        <p style={{color: 'white'}}>
          I'm a little fucked up<br />
          there's something wrong with me<br />
          is that the case<br />
          or did I have to get<br /> 
          outside to see<br />

          and now that I need you all<br />
          so desperately<br />
          I'll figure it all out<br />
          I'll figure it all out<br />
          it's so human of me<br />
